# Cloud Load Balancer Modules

This repo contains modules to perform load balancing on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/).

## Code included in this Module

* [http-load-balancer](/modules/http-load-balancer): Deploy an [HTTP Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/).


## What is Cloud Load Balancer?

[Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) is a fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all your traffic. It is not an instance or device based solution, so you wonâ€™t be locked into physical load balancing infrastructure or face the HA, scale and management challenges inherent in instance based LBs. Cloud Load Balancing features include:  

* **HTTP(S) Load Balancing:** HTTP(S) load balancing can balance HTTP and HTTPS traffic across multiple backend instances, across multiple regions.
* **Seamless Autoscaling:** Autoscaling helps your applications gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces cost when the need for resources is lower.
* **Cloud CDN Integration:** Enabling [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/) for HTTP(S) Load Balancing for optimizing application delivery for your users.
* **Stackdriver Logging:** Stackdriver Logging for load balancing logs all the load balancing requests sent to your load balancer.

You can learn more about Cloud Load Balancing in [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/).

## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
